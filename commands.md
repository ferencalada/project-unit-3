This is a compilation of the commands we've been using in git:
git init                              is used to create a new local repository with git
git clone <link to repository>        is used to create a copy of an existing repository
git add <file name.file type>         is used to add certain files to the staging area
*                                     basically, a replacement when you mean any type or any name of files
git commit -m "<commit name>"         creating and naming a commit
git status                            show the current status of the files inside the directory
git diff                              show the changes made isnce the last commit
